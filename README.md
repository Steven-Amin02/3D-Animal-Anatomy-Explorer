## Project Overview

The **3D Cat Anatomy Explorer** is an interactive web-based visualization platform that presents highly detailed cat anatomical models in three distinct formats: **Normal**, **Muscle**, and **Skeleton**. This educational tool is designed for veterinary students, educators, researchers, and animal enthusiasts seeking a deeper understanding of feline anatomy through engaging, real-time 3D exploration.

Leveraging [Three.js](https://threejs.org), this project provides a performant, immersive experience with clickable anatomical hotspots that reveal curated information panels, augmenting the learning process.

***

## Features

- **Three Anatomical Views:** Switch seamlessly between Normal, Muscle, and Skeleton models.
- **Interactive Hotspots:** Clickable markers mapped precisely to anatomical parts using raycasting, opening rich info drawers.
- **User-Friendly Controls:** OrbitControls for navigation with zoom, pan, and rotate.
- **Responsive UI:** Adaptive layout supporting accessibility and both light/dark themes.
- **Model Uploads:** Support uploading custom `.glb` models via an intuitive sidebar.
- **Optimized Rendering:** Enhanced performance through dynamic shadow resolution and efficient scene management.

***

## Architecture \& Technology Stack

- **Three.js:** WebGL-based 3D rendering engine powering the real-time 3D scene.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core scripting for model handling, scene management, UI interaction, and raycasting.
- **HTML5/CSS3:** Markup and styling for responsive, modern user interface with hot-reloading.
- **Raycasting:** Precise detection of mouse interactions with specific 3D mesh parts.
- **Modular Anatomy Data:** JSON-driven anatomy lookup for easy localization and expansion.
- **Event-Driven UI:** Hotspot clicks and UI state management through custom event handling.

***

## Installation \& Usage

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steven-amin02/cat-anatomy-explorer.git
cd cat-anatomy-explorer
```


### Open the project

Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). No build step required.

### Upload Models

Use the sidebar interface to upload `.glb` format anatomy models for Normal, Muscle, and Skeleton views.

### Navigate

- Mouse or touch controls: Rotate, pan, zoom the 3D model.
- Click hotspots to open detailed anatomy information.

***

## Detailed Functionality

### Model Handling

- Models are loaded as `GLTF` assets, centered and scaled automatically for optimal view.
- Normal, Muscle, and Skeleton are separate model states toggled via sidebar controls.


### Hotspot Implementation

- Defined relative to anatomical parts in `anatomyData`.
- Rendered as overlay elements positioned via projection of mesh world coordinates to screen space.
- Click events trigger info drawer population with structured anatomical data.


### Info Drawer

- Modular tabbed view showing Overview, Details, and Media for each anatomical part.
- Smooth animations for opening/closing embedded within the UI framework.

***

## Customization \& Extensibility

- **Adding Species:** Update JSON anatomy data and upload new 3D models.
- **Adding Model Views:** Integrate additional states with minimal code changes.
- **Localization:** Text content stored separately allowing easy translation.
- **Theme \& UI:** Adapt CSS variables for branding or accessibility needs.

***

## Performance Optimization

- Dynamic shadow map resizing balances quality and frame rate.
- Use of Three.js `PCFSoftShadowMap` for realistic yet performant shadows.
- Efficient raycasting reducing computation load.
- Responsive canvas resizing adapting to device pixel ratios.

***
